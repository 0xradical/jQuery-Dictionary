This is a set of Ruby(1.9) scripts that produce a
jQuery dictionary for the Dictionary Mac OS app.
It's nowhere near perfect so be my guest: fork it and
improve !

* Install the gem `mechanize'
* Run `jquery_api_scraper.rb'
* Run `jquery_api_parser.rb'
* Build the dictionary running `make'
* Install the dictionary running `make install'
